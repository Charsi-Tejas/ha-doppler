Raman

    - [ ] Add support for alarm list
    - [ ] Weather wake up time sensor
    - [ ] Validate entity control works (make sure function lambdas work as expected)
    - [ ] Review services
    - [ ] Add service schemas to validate and transform data as needed
    - [ ] Add support for smart buttons. We will need to register a callback to HA with each device, then create a view that will respond to the callback and fire an event. Then add device automation stuff
    - [ ] Move all weather attributes to the weather service switch and add a service to set the weather configuration
