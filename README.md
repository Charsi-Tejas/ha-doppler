# Sandman Doppler Integration

This is an integration designed to all you to access and control your Sandman Doppler inside Home Assistant. 

The integration uses local control to communicate with your Doppler using our local API: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14527424/VVQiv24k

This integration is still a work in progress and we hope to improve and add to it as we can. 

## What is a Sandman Doppler?

To use this integration you'll need a Sandman Doppler on your local network. The Sandman Doppler is a 6 USB charging smart clock with premium sound and Amazon Alexa built-in. If you don't have a Sandman Doppler you can buy one here: sandmandoppler.com 

## What can you use this integration for? 

Anything you'd like to do with the Sandman Doppler you can control and automate with your Home Assistant. Some ideas: 
1. Set the color of the screen based on the day of the week or month. This could be useful for garbage day or street cleaning day. 
2. Scott Hanselman is a customer of ours who has type-1 diabetes and wants to display his blood sugar on the small display of the Doppler. All this requires is a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that is hooked up to the internet and home assistant to link the CGM and the Doppler together. Boom, now your blood sugar is displayed on the mini display of the Doppler for you to see your blood sugar at a glance. Scott and PAI CEO, Alex talked about this on Scottâ€™s Podcast (https://hanselminutes.com/766/shipping-the-sandman-doppler-with-palo-alto-innovations-alex-tramiel) a while back and we are happy we can make this a reality for him.  
3. When your sprinklers turn on (using a smart irrigation system from a company like Rachio), the Doppler could say "enabling sprinklers"  and then turn the screen green or blue, when it's done it could turn back to your normal color. 
4. You could display the battery percentage of your phone or your electric car on the mini display. Better yet, if you forget to plug either of these in the screen could blink or change colors to remind you to plug in when you get into bed.
5. Home assistant can be granted access to your calendar so you could set multiple alarms before your meeting and flash the screen when it's time for your meeting. 
6. When the front door is opened, the Doppler could say "door" on the front screen, and if you have person detection enabled it could speak who is home.
7. When you press the 1 button it could lock all of the doors, enable your security system, turn off all the lights, set an alarm for 8 hours from now, and play white noise. You can do this with Alexa routines, but Home Assistant has more options and it would all be done locally so this would work if there was no internet access. 
8. You could program your smart smoke alarm to trigger a sound on your Doppler in case of an emergency. 
9. Have the color of the time change when it's time for bed.
10. Have the Doppler screen go to blackout mode automatically once a motion sensor stops detecting motion in your room for an hour. 

## Installation

To install this integration into your Home Assistant we are recommending your use the Home Assistant Community Store or HACS. 

1. Use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download), in `HACS > Integrations > Explore & Add Repositories` search for "Sandman Doppler". After adding this `https://github.com/pa-innovation/ha-doppler/` as a custom repository. Skip to 7.
2. If no HACS, use the tool of choice to open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
3. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
4. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `sandman_doppler`.
5. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/sandman_doppler/` directory (folder) in this repository.
6. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
7. Restart Home Assistant.
8. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Sandman Doppler".

## Creating automations from smart buttons (1 or 2 on the top of the clock)

When you integrate your Doppler(s) with Home Assistant, the integration will automatically register itself with your Doppler(s) so that when a smart button is pushed, Home Assistant is notified. There are two ways to create automations for these button presses:

1. Use Device Triggers: If you are using the Automations UI to create your automation, select the Device Trigger type and then look for your Doppler device. You will see two trigger options, one for each of the smart buttons, and selecting that will automatically trigger the automation you create when the button is pressed.

2. Use Event Triggers: If you are writing your automations by hand, or if you'd prefer to use event triggers, you can trigger on the `sandman_doppler_button_pressed` event. The event data will look as follows:

```yaml
event_data:
    device_id: 12345  # The ID of the device in Home Assistant
    dsn: "Doppler-deadbeef"  # Doppler serial number. You should not have to use or remember this.
    doppler_name: "Radar"  # The name of the doppler as configured in the Sandman Clocks app
    name: "Radar"  # The name of the device in Home Assistant. If you've never changed the name of the device in Home Assistant, this will be the same as `doppler_name`
    button: 1  # Smart button number that was pressed
    action: "press"  # Push action of the smart button. Currently only `press` is supported
```

You can use this event data in triggers and conditions to decide what actions you want Home Assistant to take. To learn more about `event` triggers, refer to the [Home Assistant documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#event-trigger).

## Advanced services

Home Assistant supports the following services to use the advanced
features of Doppler from either developer tools, or more importantly
in automations. To access these go to developer tool/services and then select the service you'd like to access. Or, go to Automations in Home Assistant and select the service you'd like to autoamte.
